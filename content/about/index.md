I am a social, forward-facing, engaged student that never backs down from a challenge. I am currently
studying my fourth year of the Computer Science and Engineering civ.ing. program at Chalmers University
of Technology. In my free time, I spend time performing music, playing video games, or hanging out with
friends and family.
